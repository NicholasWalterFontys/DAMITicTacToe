\section{Used Implementation Platform}

After conducting our research concerning this topic, we decided to make use of a family of algorithms called "reinforcement learning". These are based on the premise that either after every action or once the game or a section of the game is completed, the algorithm gets feedback on its decisions: Positive feedback if it made "good" choices, negative for "bad" choices.

Our final choice was to use Keras as our neural network framework. This is basically an interface to the tensorflow library, which for our purposes offers functionality of neural networks. Using Keras made it a lot simpler for use to define, create and use neural networks.

Another advantage of using Keras is that it is written in Python and is therefore using a programming language we are familiar with and can therefore more easily work with.
