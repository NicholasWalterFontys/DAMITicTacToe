\section{Literature Research}
After conducting our research concerning this topic, we decided to make use of a family of algorithms called "reinforcement learning". These are based on the premise that either after every action or once the game or a section of the game is completed, the algorithm gets feedback on its decisions: Positive feedback if it made "good" choices, negative for "bad" choices.

While searching the internet for information and inspiration we found an implementation of a self-driving car (\cite{Harvey17}). It was implemented with Python and used the framework Keras. This example seemed to fit our requirements and we were able to adapt it to our needs.

Even though we tried to find an existing implementation for a Tic Tac Toe AI, we could only find ones that predict which player would win based on a field instead of actually calculating the best move.
