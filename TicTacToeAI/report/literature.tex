\section{Literature Research}
After conducting our research concerning this topic, we decided to make use of a family of algorithms called "reinforcement learning". These are based on the premise that either after every action or once the game or a section of the game is completed, the algorithm gets feedback on its decisions: Positive feedback if it made "good" choices, negative for "bad" choices.
 
In our research on Google we found an implementation of a self-driving car (\cite{Harvey17}). It was implemnted with Python and uses the framework Keras. This example seams to fit our requirments and could be adapted by us.

Nevetheless we tried to search for implementation for an Tic Tac Toe AI. But there was no direct implementation. All we found predict which player wins based on the fields set.
